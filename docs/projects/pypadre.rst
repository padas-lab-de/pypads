PyPaDRE was the original experimental project developed on the context of padre-lab to track machine learning experiments. After identifying drawbacks in the basic architecture or pypadre the development on pypads was started.
The documentation for PyPaDRE can be found `here <https://pypadre.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.
