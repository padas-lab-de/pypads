PyPaDS: Documentation!
==================================

Building on the MLFlow toolset, `PyPaDS`_ aims to extend the existing tracking functionality, make logging as easy as possible for the user. The production of structured results is an
additional goal of the extension.

.. _PyPaDS: https://github.com/padre-lab-eu/pypads

.. note::
    A larger update regarding the mapping files was released recently. Mapping files are now based on YML and are more hook centric. Read more about mapping files :ref:`here <mapping_files>`.

Install PyPads
--------------

Logging your experiments manually can be overwhelming and exhaustive? PyPads is a tool to help automate logging as much information as possible by
tracking the libraries of your choice.

* **Installing PyPads**:
   :ref:`With pip <install_official_release>` |
   :ref:`From source <install_from_source>`

Getting started
---------------

Learn more about how to use pypads, configuring your tracking events and hooks, mapping your custom logging function
and some of the core features of PyPads.

* **Usage example**
   :ref:`Decision Tree Iris classification <usage_example>`

* **Mapping file example for Scikit-learn**
   A :ref:`mapping file <mappingfile>` is where we define the classes and functions to be tracked from the library of our choice. It includes the defined hooks.
* **Hooks and events**
   - :ref:`Events <events>` are defined primarily by listeners which are, in our case, **hooks**. When triggered, the corresponding loggers are called. Logging functions are linked to these events via a mapping dictionary passed to the :ref:`base class <base_class>`.
   - :ref:`Hooks <hooks>` help the user to define what triggers those events (e.g. what functions or classes should trigger a specific event).
* **Loggers**
   Logging functions are functions called around when any tracked method or class triggers their corresponding event. Mapping events to logging functions is done by passing a dictionary **mapping** as a parameter to the :ref:`PyPads class <base_class>`.

The following tables show the default loggers of pypads.
